# 3D-Renderer
A 3D Rendered made in python using the turtle module.

# Note
The axes are flipped, so $+ve x$ appears to be $-ve x$ and so on.

# Improvements
Here are a few things that I couldn't add:
 - Changing Camera direction
 - A bug displaying random lines when the program starts
 - colour and textures

# Limitaions
 - The program is not well optimized
 - The lack of textures means you cannot add your own visuals to it
 - Making a new object is very time taking
 - You can only look in one direction
 - Since it is simulating projection on a flat screen instead of a curved screen, it doesn't look realistic

# Controls
 - W to go up
 - S to go down
 - Up arrow to move forward
 - Down arrow to move backward
 - Left arrow to move to the left
 - Right arrow to move to the right
